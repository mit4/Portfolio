### Data Analysis Projects

* [Supermarket Analysis](https://github.com/mit4/Supermarket-Analysis/blob/8b9602468483525c02553c935fd41462b498a2e2/README.md)

    Conducted thorough analysis on supermarket data and created an interactive **Power BI** dashboard, facilitating data-driven decision-making for enhanced performance.

* [Facebook Ad Campaign Analysi]()

    Conducted a thorough analysis of Facebook ad campaign data, harnessing the power of **Tableau** for advanced data visualization. Our primary objective was to unveil the effectiveness of each campaign, and based on our insights, we *provided recommendations for campaign adjustments or discontinuation*.

* [FIFA Player Analysis]()

    Analyzed FIFA21 player dataset, revealing valuable insights like most valuable and high-rated players, top-producing countries of international players, and crucial player attributes for specific positions.

* [Share Price Predictor]()
  
    Engineered an advanced predictive model to forecast future share prices, incorporating the powerful **LSTM** architecture. Leveraging Nifty50 data as the primary data source, the project achieved a notable **accuracy rate of 70%.**

### Machine Learning Projects

* [Hate Tweet Prediction](/hatetweetread)

    Applied various transformations to Twitter tweets to meet specific requirements. Utilized *Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithms* for model training purposes.

* [Employment Retention Analysis]()

    Employing statistical analytics methods such as *Logistic Regression, KNN Baseline, and Random Forest* to estimate the likelihood of employee attrition within the company.

* [Loan Default Prediction]()

    Employed customer transaction data to estimate the *probability of loanee/borrower* ***defaulting*** on a vehicle loan, specifically focusing on the first Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) due on the specified date.
